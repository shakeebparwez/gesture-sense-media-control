GestureSense Media Player is a Python script that utilizes computer vision techniques and the OpenCV library to control media playback through hand gestures. The code enables users to interact with a media player by moving their hand in front of a webcam or camera. The gestures detected are Up, Down, Left, and Right, which correspond to controlling media playback functionalities like volume control, seeking, and skipping tracks.

### Requirements:
- Python 3
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- NumPy
- Time
- PyAutoGUI

### How it works:
The script captures video from the default camera, processes it to identify the user's hand using color segmentation in the HSV color space, and detects the dominant hand's centroid (center) to track its motion. The hand's motion is then used to determine the corresponding gesture, and actions are performed accordingly.

### Setup and Usage:
1. Install the required dependencies using `pip install opencv-python numpy pyautogui`.
2. Run the script.
3. A window named "Trackbars" will appear, which allows you to adjust the color segmentation parameters (Hue, Saturation, and Value) using trackbars. Adjust these values to optimize hand detection based on your environment's lighting conditions.
4. Once the script is running, you can control media playback by performing hand gestures in front of the camera.

### Supported Gestures:
- **Right**: Move your hand quickly to the right to simulate pressing the "Right" arrow key for skipping forward or seeking forward.
- **Left**: Move your hand quickly to the left to simulate pressing the "Left" arrow key for skipping backward or seeking backward.
- **Up**: Move your hand upward to simulate pressing the "Up" arrow key for increasing volume or moving to the next track.
- **Down**: Move your hand downward to simulate pressing the "Down" arrow key for decreasing volume or moving to the previous track.

### Note:
- Make sure the lighting conditions are suitable for proper hand detection.
- Adjust the `hand_detected` threshold in the code (currently set to 14000) to optimize hand detection for your environment.
